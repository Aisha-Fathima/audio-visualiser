# Audio Visualiser using javascript

step1: set up project files
        html file and a js file
        minimal styling(within html file itself, no separate style sheet)
        -inside html: 2 main elements:
            i. <input> user will upload the audio file(mp3 file) with the help of this input tag/element

            Web Audio API- to programmatically process the audio file

            ii. -<canvas> 

            Canvas API


step2: process the audio data
        convert mp3 to array 

step3: visulaising the audio data

step4: setting up a visualisation loop
        (we dont want a static bar chart, we want the data to be plotted continuously as the audio is played in realtime)
